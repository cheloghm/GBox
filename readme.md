# GBox

Gbox is an application that displays the books you've read/want/own and provides details on each book.

## Set up

This project uses nextjs for the client side, nodejs (with apollo) for the server and mongodb for the database.

You'll need to install the project dependencies before running the project. Run the following command to do so:

```sh
npm install
```

To run the server, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start:server
```

To run the front end application (in dev mode), use the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```

When running the server, ensure that the database is running too.

## Development

This project follows the github flow practice. Details of which can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

We use a automated github project board to list out all tasks; to be done, in progress and completed.
